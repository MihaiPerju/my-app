"""Scope Alembic autogenerate to the tables this app's models declare.

The database holds tables no model here describes, and each has another owner: libraries provision
their own at runtime (the search plugin's ``<collection>_chunks``, guardrailing's
``guardrail_embeddings``) and extensions ship theirs (PostGIS's ``spatial_ref_sys``). Autogenerate
compares the whole schema against ``SQLModel.metadata``, so without this filter every revision would
open with ``op.drop_table`` for each of them.

The rule is ownership, not a name list: a table that exists only in the database is never this
app's to drop. Removing one of the app's own tables is therefore a hand-written ``op.drop_table``,
which is the deliberate step it should be anyway.
