"""Infrastructure routes: unversioned, and the only ones served without a caller.

These paths are wired into APISIX, Helm startup, probes, and healthchecks, so they must not move
when the API surface gains a version. ``health.py`` serves all of them. ``/health`` always answers
200 for a human; the ``/health/*`` paths are the Kubernetes probes and stay off the gateway because
the kubelet reaches the pod directly.
