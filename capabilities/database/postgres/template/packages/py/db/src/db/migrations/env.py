"""Alembic environment configured for async SQLAlchemy (asyncpg) + SQLModel.

The connection URL is taken from db settings (``DATABASE_URL``, normalized
to the asyncpg driver) rather than alembic.ini, and ``target_metadata`` is
``SQLModel.metadata`` populated by importing every model module. Autogenerate only diffs the
tables those models declare (``db.schema_filter``), so tables a library or extension owns are left
alone.

The migration set is one independent branch per capability that owns a table (each rooted at
``down_revision = None`` and labelled with the capability id), so it may have several heads:
upgrade to ``heads``, never ``head``.
