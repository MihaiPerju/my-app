 * This capability ships no library: everything it contributes is the evaluation harness and its schedules, carried
 * in the vendored template (template/). The npm package is how that template zone and this
 * capability's `capability.json` reach an app installed from the npm registry, which is why
 * `packages` declares `"ts"` — and it keeps the capability a type-checkable workspace member.
